> Self custody made simple and secure. Protect your crypto and store your private keys offline.

[AirGap](https://airgap.it) is a crypto wallet system that lets you secure cypto assets with one secret on an offline device. The [AirGap Vault](https://github.com/airgap-it/airgap-vault) application is installed on a dedicated device that has no connection to any network, thus it is air gapped. The AirGap Wallet is installed on your everyday smartphone.

## Description

AirGap Wallet has an overview of all accounts with their respective balances and transaction histories. AirGap Wallet never touches your secret data stored in the AirGap Vault. It is responsible for creating and broadcasting transactions. The prepared transaction is sent to the secure Vault over QR codes, where it is securely signed and sent back.

AirGap Wallet is a hybrid application (using the same codebase for Android and iOS). Created using AirGap's protocol agnostic `airgap-coin-lib` library to interact with different protocols and our own secure storage implementation.
